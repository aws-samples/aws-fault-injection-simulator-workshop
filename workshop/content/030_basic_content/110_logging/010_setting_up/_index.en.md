High level idea of what are we trying to retail beyond the default 30 days of CloudWatch:
* The time and date the experiment ran
* Success/Fail results for each step and the overall experiment in state sections
* An abridged version of the actual content of the experiment template used, as opposed to the current content if anyone updated or deleted it since then.

We will use lambda here, the lambda will be invoked by EventBridge event from gets generated by a running experiment,
The lambda will gather all the needed data from the event and pull the template from FIS to maintain it as it looks like that memoent.
