# Getting Started

To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< ref "self_paced/" >}}), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< ref "aws_event/" >}})

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a Workspace**]({{< ref "/020_starting_workshop/workspace" >}})
