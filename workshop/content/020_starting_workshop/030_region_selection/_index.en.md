This workshop relies heavily on AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS) and assumes you will be running all your experiments in the same region. AWS FIS is currently available in the [regions listed here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/fis.html#fis_region). 

If not otherwise instructed, please _pick an appropriate region_ from the list and perform all the operations in the workshop in that region.
