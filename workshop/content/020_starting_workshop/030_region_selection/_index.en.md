This workshop relies heavily on AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) and assumes you will be running all your experiments in the same region. If not otherwise instructed, please [**choose a region**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/fis.html#fis_region) in which FIS is currently available. 

To select this region for navigate to the [**AWS Console**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) and select the desired region from the drop-down menu on the top right:

A number of services, in particular AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), are region independent and will show **"Global"** as the selection.
