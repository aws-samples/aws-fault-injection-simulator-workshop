Before we start running fault injection experiments we need to provision our resources in the cloud. The rest of the workshop uses these resources.

Clone the repository

```
cd ~/environment
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-fault-injection-simulator-workshop.git
```

Deploy the resources

```
cd aws-fault-injection-simulator-workshop
cd resources/templates
./deploy-parallel.sh
```

It can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
