## Charter / decisions

Like tenets all of these are up for debate

* ultimate deliverable has to work with EE and thus be CFN code but we are ok starting with CDK. If you want to use CDK for any part please use TS so we can easily integrate
* backlog is currently under [issues, labeled with "backlog"](resources/templates/)
* you can't push straight to main, we want pull-requests. If reviews become a bottleneck we can revisit this
